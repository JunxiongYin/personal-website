I am a PhD Candidate in the Data Sciences and Operations department at the USC Marshall School of Business, advised by Professor [Peng Shi](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Peng-Shi/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Business Administration from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research focuses on reducing the waste incurred in non-monetary allocation mechanisms, such as cadaveric organ allocation. I investigate alternative mechanisms and evaluate the associated trade-offs through both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis. 

During PhD, I interned in the Rider Session Pricing team at Uber as an Applied Scientist.
